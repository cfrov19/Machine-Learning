# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Machine Learning.ipynb`) that demonstrates basic machine learning concepts and implementations.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection and engineering  
- Model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)  
- Model evaluation and performance metrics  

The goal is to provide a practical introduction to machine learning workflows.

## ðŸš€ Requirements
To run the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
